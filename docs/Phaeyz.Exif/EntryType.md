| UInt16 | `3` | An unsigned 16-bit value. |
| UInt32 | `4` | An unsigned 16-bit value. |
| UnsignedRational | `5` | Two unsigned 32-bit values (a numerator and a denominator) making a rational, rendered through the UnsignedRational type. |
| SByte | `6` | A signed 8-bit value. |
| ByteSequence | `7` | A sequence of uninterpreted bytes. In the EXIF spec this is the "UNKNOWN" type. |
