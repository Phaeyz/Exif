# Tag.CreatePreserveDataBlock method (1 of 2)

Creates a tag where the value is an offset to a block of data of unknown size, and best effort is attempted to preserve the data block during deserialization.

```csharp
public static Tag CreatePreserveDataBlock(Tag? parent, int? index, ushort value, string? name, 
    IEnumerable<(string key, string category)>? aliases)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| parent | The parent directory tag the current tag must exist under. If `null` this tag may appear in every parent directory. |
| index | The index of parent directory set which this tag must exist within. If `null` this tag may appear in any of the array of parent directories. |
| value | The UINT16 value of the tag which is serialized to the EXIF. |
| name | A friendly name for the tag. Only used for debugging. |
| aliases | Aliases for the tag. The key a namespace name such as "Exif.Image.ImageWidth", and the value is the category such as "Image". |
