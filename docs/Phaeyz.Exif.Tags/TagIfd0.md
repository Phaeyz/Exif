| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [TagIfd0](TagIfd0/TagIfd0.md)() | The default constructor. |
| static readonly [AnalogBalance](TagIfd0/AnalogBalance.md) | Normally the stored raw values are not white balanced, since any digital white balancing will reduce the dynamic range of the final image if the user decides to later adjust the white balance; however, if camera hardware is capable of white balancing the color channels before the signal is digitized, it can improve the dynamic range of the final image. AnalogBalance defines the gain, either analog (recommended) or digital (not recommended) that has been applied the stored raw values. |
| static readonly [ApplicationNotes](TagIfd0/ApplicationNotes.md) | XMP Metadata (Adobe technote 9-14-02) |
| static readonly [AsShotIccProfile](TagIfd0/AsShotIccProfile.md) | This tag contains an ICC profile that, in conjunction with the AsShotPreProfileMatrix tag, provides the camera manufacturer with a way to specify a default color rendering from camera color space coordinates (linear reference values) into the ICC profile connection space. The ICC profile connection space is an output referred colorimetric space, whereas the other color calibration tags in DNG specify a conversion into a scene referred colorimetric space. This means that the rendering in this profile should include any desired tone and gamut mapping needed to convert between scene referred values and output referred values. |
| static readonly [AsShotNeutral](TagIfd0/AsShotNeutral.md) | Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as the coordinates of a perfectly neutral color in linear reference space values. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotWhiteXY tag. |
| static readonly [AsShotPreProfileMatrix](TagIfd0/AsShotPreProfileMatrix.md) | This tag is used in conjunction with the AsShotICCProfile tag. It specifies a matrix that should be applied to the camera color space coordinates before processing the values through the ICC profile specified in the AsShotICCProfile tag. The matrix is stored in the row scan order. If ColorPlanes is greater than three, then this matrix can (but is not required to) reduce the dimensionality of the color data down to three components, in which case the AsShotICCProfile should have three rather than ColorPlanes input components. |
| static readonly [AsShotProfileName](TagIfd0/AsShotProfileName.md) | A UTF-8 encoded string containing the name of the "as shot" camera profile, if any. |
| static readonly [AsShotWhiteXy](TagIfd0/AsShotWhiteXy.md) | Specifies the selected white balance at time of capture, encoded as x-y chromaticity coordinates. The inclusion of this tag precludes the inclusion of the AsShotNeutral tag. |
| static readonly [BaselineExposure](TagIfd0/BaselineExposure.md) | Camera models vary in the trade-off they make between highlight headroom and shadow noise. Some leave a significant amount of highlight headroom during a normal exposure. This allows significant negative exposure compensation to be applied during raw conversion, but also means normal exposures will contain more shadow noise. Other models leave less headroom during normal exposures. This allows for less negative exposure compensation, but results in lower shadow noise for normal exposures. Because of these differences, a raw converter needs to vary the zero point of its exposure compensation control from model to model. BaselineExposure specifies by how much (in EV units) to move the zero point. Positive values result in brighter default results, while negative values result in darker default results. |
| static readonly [BaselineExposureOffset](TagIfd0/BaselineExposureOffset.md) | Provides a way for color profiles to increase or decrease exposure during raw conversion. BaselineExposureOffset specifies the amount (in EV units) to add to the BaselineExposure tag during image rendering. For example, if the BaselineExposure value for a given camera model is +0.3, and the BaselineExposureOffset value for a given camera profile used to render an image for that camera model is -0.7, then the actual default exposure value used during rendering will be +0.3 - 0.7 = -0.4. |
| static readonly [BaselineNoise](TagIfd0/BaselineNoise.md) | Specifies the relative noise level of the camera model at a baseline ISO value of 100, compared to a reference camera model. Since noise levels tend to vary approximately with the square root of the ISO value, a raw converter can use this value, combined with the current ISO, to estimate the relative noise level of the current image. |
| static readonly [BaselineSharpness](TagIfd0/BaselineSharpness.md) | Specifies the relative amount of sharpening required for this camera model, compared to a reference camera model. Camera models vary in the strengths of their anti-aliasing filters. Cameras with weak or no filters require less sharpening than cameras with strong anti-aliasing filters. |
| static readonly [CalibrationIlluminant1](TagIfd0/CalibrationIlluminant1.md) | The illuminant used for the first set of color calibration tags (ColorMatrix1, CameraCalibration1, ReductionMatrix1). The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the LightSource EXIF tag. If set to 255 (Other), then the IFD must also include a IlluminantData1 tag to specify the x-y chromaticity or spectral power distribution function for this illuminant. |
| static readonly [CalibrationIlluminant2](TagIfd0/CalibrationIlluminant2.md) | The illuminant used for an optional second set of color calibration tags (ColorMatrix2, CameraCalibration2, ReductionMatrix2). The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the CalibrationIlluminant1 tag; however, if both are included, neither is allowed to have a value of 0 (unknown). If set to 255 (Other), then the IFD must also include a IlluminantData2 tag to specify the x-y chromaticity or spectral power distribution function for this illuminant. |
| static readonly [CalibrationIlluminant3](TagIfd0/CalibrationIlluminant3.md) | The illuminant used for an optional third set of color calibration tags (ColorMatrix3, CameraCalibration3, ReductionMatrix3). The legal values for this tag are the same as the legal values for the LightSource EXIF tag; CalibrationIlluminant1 and CalibrationIlluminant2 must also be present. If set to 255 (Other), then the IFD must also include a IlluminantData3 tag to specify the x-y chromaticity or spectral power distribution function for this illuminant. |
| static readonly [CameraCalibration1](TagIfd0/CameraCalibration1.md) | CameraCalibration1 defines a calibration matrix that transforms reference camera native space values to individual camera native space values under the first calibration illuminant.

This table uses the same format as the tables stored in the ProfileHueSatMapData1 and ProfileHueSatMapData2 tags, and is applied in the same color space. However, it should be applied later in the processing pipe, after any exposure compensation and/or fill light stages, but before any tone curve stage. Each entry of the table contains three 32-bit IEEE floating-point values. The first entry is hue shift in degrees, the second entry is a saturation scale factor, and the third entry is a value scale factor. The table entries are stored in the tag in nested loop order, with the value divisions in the outer loop, the hue divisions in the middle loop, and the saturation divisions in the inner loop. All zero input saturation entries are required to have a value scale factor of 1.0. |
| static readonly [ProfileLookTableDims](TagIfd0/ProfileLookTableDims.md) | This tag specifies the number of input samples in each dimension of a default "look" table. The data for this table is stored in the ProfileLookTableData tag. |
| static readonly [ProfileLookTableEncoding](TagIfd0/ProfileLookTableEncoding.md) | Provides a way for color profiles to specify how indexing into a 3D LookTable is performed during raw conversion. This tag is not applicable to a 2.5D LookTable (i.e., where the Value dimension is 1). |
| static readonly [ProfileName](TagIfd0/ProfileName.md) | A UTF-8 encoded string containing the name of the camera profile. This tag is optional if there is only a single camera profile stored in the file but is required for all camera profiles if there is more than one camera profile stored in the file. |
| static readonly [ProfileToneCurve](TagIfd0/ProfileToneCurve.md) | This tag contains a default tone curve that can be applied while processing the image as a starting point for user adjustments. The curve is specified as a list of 32-bit IEEE floating-point value pairs in linear gamma. Each sample has an input value in the range of 0.0 to 1.0, and an output value in the range of 0.0 to 1.0. The first sample is required to be (0.0, 0.0), and the last sample is required to be (1.0, 1.0). Interpolated the curve using a cubic spline. |
| static readonly [Rating](TagIfd0/Rating.md) | Rating tag used by Windows |
| static readonly [RatingPercent](TagIfd0/RatingPercent.md) | Rating tag used by Windows, value in percent |
| static readonly [RawDataUniqueId](TagIfd0/RawDataUniqueId.md) | This tag contains a 16-byte unique identifier for the raw image data in the DNG file. DNG readers can use this tag to recognize a particular raw image, even if the file's name or the metadata contained in the file has been changed. If a DNG writer creates such an identifier, it should do so using an algorithm that will ensure that it is very unlikely two different images will end up having the same identifier. |
| static readonly [RawImageDigest](TagIfd0/RawImageDigest.md) | This tag is an MD5 digest of the raw image data. All pixels in the image are processed in row-scan order. Each pixel is zero padded to 16 or 32 bits deep (16-bit for data less than or equal to 16 bits deep, 32-bit otherwise). The data for each pixel is processed in little-endian byte order. |
| static readonly [RawToPreviewGain](TagIfd0/RawToPreviewGain.md) | The gain (what number the sample values are multiplied by) between the main raw IFD and the preview IFD containing this tag. |
| static readonly [ReductionMatrix1](TagIfd0/ReductionMatrix1.md) | ReductionMatrix1 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the first calibration illuminant. This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3. The matrix is stored in row scan order. |
| static readonly [ReductionMatrix2](TagIfd0/ReductionMatrix2.md) | ReductionMatrix2 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the second calibration illuminant. This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3. The matrix is stored in row scan order. |
| static readonly [ReductionMatrix3](TagIfd0/ReductionMatrix3.md) | ReductionMatrix3 defines a dimensionality reduction matrix for use as the first stage in converting color camera native space values to XYZ values, under the third calibration illuminant. This tag may only be used if ColorPlanes is greater than 3. The matrix is stored in row scan order. |
| static readonly [ReelName](TagIfd0/ReelName.md) | The optional ReelName tag shall specify a name for a sequence of images, where each image in the sequence has a unique image identifier (including but not limited to file name, frame number, date time, time code). |
| static readonly [RgbTables](TagIfd0/RgbTables.md) | This tag specifies color transforms that can be applied to masked image regions. Color transforms are specified using RGB-to-RGB color lookup tables. These tables are associated with Semantic Masks to limit the color transform to a sub-region of the image. The overall color transform is a linear combination of the color tables, weighted by their corresponding Semantic Masks. |
| static readonly [Seal](TagIfd0/Seal.md) | SEAL (0xCEA1) |

| static readonly [TimeCodes](TagIfd0/TimeCodes.md) | The optional TimeCodes tag shall contain an ordered array of time codes. All time codes shall be 8 bytes long and in binary format. The tag may contain from 1 to 10 time codes. When the tag contains more than one time code, the first one shall be the default time code. This specification does not prescribe how to use multiple time codes. Each time code shall be as defined for the 8-byte time code structure in SMPTE 331M-2004, Section 8.3. See also SMPTE 12-1-2008 and SMPTE 309-1999. |
| static readonly [TStop](TagIfd0/TStop.md) | The optional TStop tag shall specify the T-stop of the actual lens, expressed as an unsigned rational number. T-stop is also known as T-number or the photometric aperture of the lens. (F-number is the geometric aperture of the lens.) When the exact value is known, the T-stop shall be specified using a single number. Alternately, two numbers shall be used to indicate a T-stop range, in which case the first number shall be the minimum T-stop and the second number shall be the maximum T-stop. |
| static readonly [UniqueCameraModel](TagIfd0/UniqueCameraModel.md) | Defines a unique, non-localized name for the camera model that created the image in the raw file. This name should include the manufacturer's name to avoid conflicts, and should not be localized, even if the camera name itself is localized for different markets (see LocalizedCameraModel). This string may be used by reader software to index into per-model preferences and replacement profiles. |
