# TagIfd0.UniqueCameraModel field

Defines a unique, non-localized name for the camera model that created the image in the raw file. This name should include the manufacturer's name to avoid conflicts, and should not be localized, even if the camera name itself is localized for different markets (see LocalizedCameraModel). This string may be used by reader software to index into per-model preferences and replacement profiles.

```csharp
public static readonly Tag UniqueCameraModel;
```

## Remarks

Expected type is Ascii.
