# TagIfd0.ProfileLookTableData field

This tag contains a default "look" table that can be applied while processing the image as a starting point for user adjustment. This table uses the same format as the tables stored in the ProfileHueSatMapData1 and ProfileHueSatMapData2 tags, and is applied in the same color space. However, it should be applied later in the processing pipe, after any exposure compensation and/or fill light stages, but before any tone curve stage. Each entry of the table contains three 32-bit IEEE floating-point values. The first entry is hue shift in degrees, the second entry is a saturation scale factor, and the third entry is a value scale factor. The table entries are stored in the tag in nested loop order, with the value divisions in the outer loop, the hue divisions in the middle loop, and the saturation divisions in the inner loop. All zero input saturation entries are required to have a value scale factor of 1.0.

```csharp
public static readonly Tag ProfileLookTableData;
```

## Remarks
