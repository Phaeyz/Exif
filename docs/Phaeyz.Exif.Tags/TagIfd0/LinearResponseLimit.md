# TagIfd0.LinearResponseLimit field

Some sensors have an unpredictable non-linearity in their response as they near the upper limit of their encoding range. This non-linearity results in color shifts in the highlight areas of the resulting image unless the raw converter compensates for this effect. LinearResponseLimit specifies the fraction of the encoding range above which the response may become significantly non-linear.

```csharp
public static readonly Tag LinearResponseLimit;
```

## Remarks

Expected type is URational.
