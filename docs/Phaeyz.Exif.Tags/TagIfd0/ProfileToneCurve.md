# TagIfd0.ProfileToneCurve field

This tag contains a default tone curve that can be applied while processing the image as a starting point for user adjustments. The curve is specified as a list of 32-bit IEEE floating-point value pairs in linear gamma. Each sample has an input value in the range of 0.0 to 1.0, and an output value in the range of 0.0 to 1.0. The first sample is required to be (0.0, 0.0), and the last sample is required to be (1.0, 1.0). Interpolated the curve using a cubic spline.
