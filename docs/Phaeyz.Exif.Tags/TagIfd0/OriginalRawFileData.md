# TagIfd0.OriginalRawFileData field

If the DNG file was converted from a non-DNG raw file, then this tag contains the compressed contents of that original raw file. The contents of this tag always use the big-endian byte order. The tag contains a sequence of data blocks. Future versions of the DNG specification may define additional data blocks, so DNG readers should ignore extra bytes when parsing this tag. DNG readers should also detect the case where data blocks are missing from the end of the sequence, and should assume a default value for all the missing blocks. There are no padding or alignment bytes between data blocks.

```csharp
public static readonly Tag OriginalRawFileData;
```

## Remarks

Expected type is Undefined.
