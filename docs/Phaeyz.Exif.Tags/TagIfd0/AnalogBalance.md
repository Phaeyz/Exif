# TagIfd0.AnalogBalance field

Normally the stored raw values are not white balanced, since any digital white balancing will reduce the dynamic range of the final image if the user decides to later adjust the white balance; however, if camera hardware is capable of white balancing the color channels before the signal is digitized, it can improve the dynamic range of the final image. AnalogBalance defines the gain, either analog (recommended) or digital (not recommended) that has been applied the stored raw values.

```csharp
public static readonly Tag AnalogBalance;
```

## Remarks

Expected type is URational[n].
