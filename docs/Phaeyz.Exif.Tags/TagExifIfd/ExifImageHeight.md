# TagExifIfd.ExifImageHeight field

Information specific to compressed data. When a compressed file is recorded, the valid height of the meaningful image must be recorded in this tag, whether or not there is padding data or a restart marker. This tag should not exist in an uncompressed file. Since data padding is unnecessary in the vertical direction, the number of lines recorded in this valid image height tag will in fact be the same as that recorded in the SOF.

```csharp
public static readonly Tag ExifImageHeight;
```

## Remarks

Expected type is UInt32.
