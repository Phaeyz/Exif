# TagSubIfd.ChromaBlurRadius field

ChromaBlurRadius provides a hint to the DNG reader about how much chroma blur should be applied to the image. If this tag is omitted, the reader will use its default amount of chroma blurring. Normally this tag is only included for non-CFA images, since the amount of chroma blur required for mosaic images is highly dependent on the de-mosaic algorithm, in which case the DNG reader's default value is likely optimized for its particular de-mosaic algorithm.

```csharp
public static readonly Tag ChromaBlurRadius;
```

## Remarks

Expected type is URational.
