# TagSubIfd.DefaultScale field

DefaultScale is required for cameras with non-square pixels. It specifies the default scale factors for each direction to convert the image to square pixels. Typically these factors are selected to approximately preserve total pixel count. For CFA images that use CFALayout equal to 2, 3, 4, or 5, such as the Fujifilm SuperCCD, these two values should usually differ by a factor of 2.0.

```csharp
public static readonly Tag DefaultScale;
```

## Remarks

Expected type is URational[2].
