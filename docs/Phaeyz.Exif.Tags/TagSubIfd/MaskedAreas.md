# TagSubIfd.MaskedAreas field

This tag contains a list of non-overlapping rectangle coordinates of fully masked pixels, which can be optionally used by DNG readers to measure the black encoding level. The order of each rectangle's coordinates is: top, left, bottom, right. If the raw image data has already had its black encoding level subtracted, then this tag should not be used, since the masked pixels are no longer useful.

```csharp
public static readonly Tag MaskedAreas;
```

## Remarks

Expected type is UInt32[n].
