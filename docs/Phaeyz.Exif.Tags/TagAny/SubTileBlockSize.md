# TagAny.SubTileBlockSize field

Normally, the pixels within a tile are stored in simple row-scan order. This tag specifies that the pixels within a tile should be grouped first into rectangular blocks of the specified size. These blocks are stored in row-scan order. Within each block, the pixels are stored in row-scan order. The use of a non-default value for this tag requires setting the DNGBackwardVersion tag to at least 1.2.0.0.

```csharp
public static readonly Tag SubTileBlockSize;
```

## Remarks

Expected type is UInt32.
